// Teachers: Need Gridworld handouts (4 handouts with descriptions of World, Bug, Grid and Location objects. look for laminated sheets.)

//In this exercise weâ€™ll use OBJECTS and METHODS to make a world that contains bugs and flowers.

//Before you start, you need to add the gridworld.jar to your Level 1 project. 

//Right click your project, then click Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries > Add External JAR.

//Select the gridworld.jar under the Google Drive > league-jars, then say OK.



//Use the laminated handout to complete these challenges:

//Figure out how to get the World to show.
//Figure out how to add a Bug to the world (clue: you will need the Bug and Location objects)
//Add another bug at a random location in the world.
//Change the color of that bug to blue.
//Make the bug face to the right.
//Add flowers to the left and right of the bug.
//Fill the whole world with flowers!

//[Optional] Color the flowers in rows like the American flag (red & white)
//[Optional] Use a new class to make an X out of bugs.
public class GridWorld{
public static void main(String[] args){
World namd= new World();
namd.show();
Bug has= new Bug();
}
}
